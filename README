MASSDIFFUSION is a MATLAB toolbox under construction demonstrating how to new analytical solutions for complex 
1D mass diffusion problems. Current implementation covers exact analytical solutions for Third kind boundary 
problems and piece-wise analytical solutions. Future extensions will present the first analytical solutions for 
multilayer structures.
